# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge. I am going to use Zig to solve the problems.

## Running

To run solution for a day, use the command `zig build run_<day>`. Here, day is a formatted 2 digit number. For example, to run the solution for day 1, use `zig build run_01`.

## Tests

Small unit tests are written for each solution as well. To run tests for a given day, use `zig build test_<day>`. For example, to run the tests for day 1, use `zig build test_01`.
